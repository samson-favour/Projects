          learning to code is a slow process a
          <span>quitting won't speed it up</span> some people might be able to
          learn how to code in just a few weeks others might take years to fully
          understand the magic of code. learning to code is one of the most
          difficult things you will attempt in life there is no easy path, there
          is no shortcut to mastering the art of coding wake up early stay up
          late make time to code study for three hours each day
          <span>take no days off</span> ask yourself a question is what you're
          doing right now getting closer to where you want to be, life is full
          of distractions five minutes here five minutes there and your whole
          day passes you by and you are not closer to where you want to be
          either you've on your day or your day want you I know we all want to
          feel comfortable but your pursuit of comfort might be what's holding
          you back, your brain tries to steer you towards your comfort zone but
          realize nothing goes there when you're comfortable you might tell
          yourself I'll do it later or I'll do it tomorrow often later becomes
          never, <span>do it now </span>, maybe you're a thinker I'm a thinker I
          like to think about things I tend to say deep dives into my thinking
          process the problem is if you spend too much time thinking you might
          not get things done so maybe now is the time for you to stop thinking
          about learning to code and just start learning to code
          <span
            >knowledge is not power knowledge is just half of power,success
            requires action</span
          >
          but remember there are no shortcuts learn the fundamentals first take
          it step by step learn the syntax of decoding language you want to
          learn and then learn how to think like a programmer, first solve the
          problem then write the code in life there will be people around you
          who may not understand what you're trying to accomplish they might
          even try to talk you out of it but remember this your dream is your
          dream not theirs one problem that we all have that we all face is that
          we have too many options too many decisions to make this often stops
          us in our tracks so what's the solution eliminate your options take
          away your safety net, burn your bridges. so you can't go back fear can
          often drag us back into our comfort zone make a decision and run with
          it don't second-guess yourself and don't give yourself away out
          there's a reason why Bill Gates takes part in think weeks his cabin is
          a sanctuary free from distractions he spends his time reading learning
          drawing so turn off the TV put your phone and do not disturb stop
          checking your email every five minutes don't regret how you spend your
          time , we can't turn back the hands of time but we can control what we
          do right now with our time, don't let yesterday take up too much of
          today but that being said 10 years from now you will look back at the
          you of today what will you think about yourself don't be afraid of
          failure you learn more from failure than you do from success
          <span>making mistakes is part of the process</span> this is something
          I like to tell myself failure will never overtake me if my
          determination to succeed is strong enough life will knock you down is
          up to you if you get back up life will put obstacles in your way is up
          to you if you let it stop you from achieving your dreams life will be
          challenging, it's those challenges that make life so exciting we live
          in the greatest moment in time you have all the knowledge in the world
          right at your fingertips all you have to do is
          <a href="google.com" target="_blank"> google</a> it,<span
            >your potential is only limited by your mindset</span
          >
          we all need to be a little bit more disciplined, discipline is doing
          what needs to be done even if you don't want to do it did you know
          there are two billion two hundred and seventy million 592 thousand
          seconds in the average lifetime question how do you spend each moment
          my advice here don't just work hard work smart don't just work smart
          work hard
          <span>success is only your responsibility get code done</span> .

          what is CODING:
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-1">
          writing code is writing a precise set of instructions a computer or
          device can understand,it's explaining exactly what you want your
          computer to do at any given moment computers need to know exactly how
          to react to things like the clicking of a mouse or the pushing of a
          button and whatever happens ultimately is happening because of lines
          of code written by a human programmer, just about anything with a plug
          or battery uses code it's keeping our airplanes in the air it's
          allowing you to swipe a credit card and the computer doesn't know what
          to do in any given situation it has to be taught everything so you can
          think of a computer programmer explaining to a computer what we want
          it to do, for instance, trying to give someone directions on how to
          drive somewhere when they don't even know what a car is, so you can
          see what kind of complications you'd run into you'd have to not only
          tell them how to get to where they're going but you'd also have to
          give them contingency plans for things like what if there's a traffic
          jam or what if a truck breaks down in the turn lane and you'd even
          need to explain precisely how the steering wheel or gas pedal works so
          that's kind of a computer programmer writing code for a computer they
          have to basically teach it everything every time to understand that
          communication and how this process even started you have to go back to
          the Industrial Revolution where the first computer program was
          invented in 1801 by a guy named Joseph jacquard he developed a system
          of weaving instructions or code for his sewing looms that could be
          stored on cards with holes and there was a mechanism that would go
          along the card and try to push a pin through and so either the pin
          would go through or what it's binary it's either does or a dozen it's
          a one or a 2-0 and so if the pin goes through the hole it would allow
          a bride attached to it to lift which lifts the string and lifts the
          associated thread and if the pin does not go through a hole the pin
          doesn't move and the thread doesn't move so essentially the card would
          hold a preset pattern that is read by the loom and serves as a guide
          giving the direction to the threads one at a time and with this
          contraption you could create very fancy pieces of weaving in this idea
          of there being recorded information read by a machine was quickly
          barreled to be applied to mathematical computation Charles Babbage
          invented the analytical engine in 1837 and it was basically a
          calculating machine eventually transistors are invented to replace
          punch cards as a way of transferring data and nowadays we use
          computers that have billions and billions of transistors but still
          carrying that same basic idea of on and off to carry data as a way of
          harnessing these various combinations of transistors we use code
          computer programmers use different languages whether it's Python for
          gaming Java for desktop applications or effective C for an iPhone app
          a computer program is only a text file following those rules and it's
          eventually translated into something the computer can understand just
          like the pins on jacquards loom computer can only understand two
          things think of 1 & 0 as the alphabet of a computer it's like if you
          look at the alphabet of the English language there's only 26 letters
          and by themselves they're meaningless but when you combine them in two
          different ways you get the Great Gatsby or Romeo and Juliet in the
          same way billions of different combinations of ones and zeros have the
          potential to give us Microsoft Word or iTunes and the process goes
          like this and the top lovely of a human writing code for a specific
          computer language and after this the cool is translated or compiled
          into a low level in which I call the compiler and finally the code is
          translated into binary or machine language by an assembler so because
          we have a way of translating human orders in the form of code into
          ones and zeros that a computer can understand after that it's really
          just a matter of what you want the computer to do and it's like being
          a chef writing and recipe because both chefs writing recipes and
          computer programmers writing code both have the ability to create
          something awesome using the resources and tools of arrow.
